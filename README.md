#link on netlify: yonas-michael-portfolio.netlify.app

## Project Overview

This is a single-page personal portfolio website built exclusively with HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills and projects, uniquely infused with abstract Ethiopian cultural aesthetics. The design blends modern web development with heritage, creating a professional and visually captivating online presence.

## Cultural Inspiration

The design subtly reflects Ethiopian culture through:

-   **Color Palette**: Modern gradients inspired by the Ethiopian flag (green, yellow, red).
-   **Abstract Shapes & Patterns**: Geometric lines (Axum obelisk-inspired) and woven textures hint at traditional Ethiopian art.
-   **Coffee Bean Motifs**: Subtle circular shapes allude to Ethiopia's rich coffee culture.

## Key Features

-   **Navigation Header**: Fixed bar with cultural logo (YM) and smooth scrolling.
-   **Hero Section**: Prominent personal introduction, profile image, and call-to-action buttons.
-   **About Me Section**: Detailed biography, skills showcase, and a prominent CV download button styled with a woven pattern.
-   **Projects Section**: Displays three featured projects:
    1.  **Archive Management System**
    2.  **Learning Management System**
    3.  **E-commerce Platform**
-   **Contact Section**: Simple email form and contact information.

## Technical Details

-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Clean, semantic markup and advanced CSS for styling and layout.
-   **Pure CSS Animations**: All visual effects (hover, floating elements, patterns) are achieved without JavaScript.
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully adapts to all screen sizes using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries.
